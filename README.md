# Rubicon Assignment App

This app was made as Rubicon test assignment, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Notes about App
 ### Api key: 
 Although  it is a bad practice to keep API key inside src, and not in something like .ENV file, I put him directly in API calls for testing purposes
 ### Technologies:
 Dependencies that are included in the app are: React, React-router-dom, Redux Redux-thunk, React-redux, Redux-devtools-extension and React-player.
 ### Typescript:
 It was my first time using Typescript with React and Redux, and it was a nice experience, so I hope I did a good job of setting up types, interfaces, etc. Really looking         forward to hear feedback from you.
